~~~~~~~~~~~~~ FEATURES ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[] change endif, endwhile, etc, to just end
[] for loops
[] lower structure spawing by y=1
[] add a delete button to program
[] add objective on set_objective call
[] print error for no macro found
[+] and, or
[] !=
[] sleep macro
[] if `` then `` else `` endif
[] if `` then `` elseif `` then `` ... else `` endif
[] notation for specifying objective, e.g. $i:trigger_obj = $j:vars is equivalent to $i:trigger_obj = $j
[] not
[] macro calls within expression
[] nested macro calls #not within the macro, but withing the call of the macro. e.g. execute(@p, ~, ~, ~, tp(@p, ~, ~, ~))
[] add tags to armorstand for easy deleting
[] add a warning if you dont specify prefix/objective

~~~~~~~~~~~ OPTIMIZATIONS ~~~~~~~~~~~
[] only assign constants to scores once per value
[] simplify grammar rules and actions (remove if len(t)... can just use another rule)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~ BUGS ~~~~~~~~~~~
[] set() macro can't accept NUM as last argument
[] make constants for and/or evaluate to 1 or 0 regardelless of real value (e.g. "9 or 0")






#sidenote make a bunch of macros
