~~~~~~~~~~~~~ FEATURES ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[+] change endif, endwhile, etc, to just end
[] for loops
[] lower structure spawing by y=1
[] reduce bounding box of structure to min(32, coord_length)
[] add a delete button to programs
[] add objective on set_objective call
[] print error for no macro found
[+] and, or
[] !=
[] sleep macro
[+] if `` then `` else `` endif
[] if `` then `` elseif `` then `` ... else `` endif
[] notation for specifying objective, (e.g. $i:trigger_obj = $j)
[] not
[] macro calls within expression
[] nested macro calls #e.g. execute(@p, ~, ~, ~, tp(@p, ~, ~, ~))
[] add tags to armorstand for easy deleting
[] add a warning if you dont specify prefix/objective
[] create result_of macro()
[] allow selectors to be used in place of variable names
[] assertion

~~~~~~~~~~~ OPTIMIZATIONS ~~~~~~~~~~~
[] only assign constants to scores once per value
[] simplify grammar rules and actions (remove if len(t)... can just use another rule/action)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~ BUGS ~~~~~~~~~~~
[] set() macro can't accept NUM as last argument
[] make constants for and/or evaluate to 1 or 0 regardelless of real value (e.g. "9 or 0" should be 1, not 9)
[] can't call macro without arguments

~~~~~~~~~~ SECURITY ~~~~~~~~~~~~
[?] use ast.literal_eval instead of eval
[] before release, comment out exec macro. (If someone hosts this they need to be aware of that)
[] check for other uses of exec or similar





#sidenote make a bunch of macros
